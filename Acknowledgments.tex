\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements} 

I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Francesco Candeloro Billari,
for his guidance, immense knowledge and support of this work. I am
also deeply grateful to my lecturers Prof. Nicoletta Balbo, who instilled
in me the passion for empirical analysis, and Prof. Thorsten Grohsjean,
who encouraged this idea from the very beginning.

This thesis would not have been possible without the aid and support
of my friends and valuable proofreaders Edoardo, Manuele, Marco and
Valentina. I owe them much.

Last but by no means least, I wish to thank my parents, my great emotional
(and financial...) supporters who every day encourage me in all of
my passions and inspire me to chase my dreams.\clearpage{}
